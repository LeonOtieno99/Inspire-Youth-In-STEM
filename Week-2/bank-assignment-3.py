#write a program that calculates 
#16% if ranging between 100k-150k
#19% if tax income is between 150k-300k
#30% if tax income is above 300k
#5% if income is less than 100k
#print gross income and net income

#Formulae gross_income = net income + taxes

net_income = int(input("Enter your Net income "))

#above 300k
if(net_income >= 300000):
	gross_income = net_income + ((30/100)*net_income)
